# Assignment 3 Solution Guide

This document provides detailed solutions to Assignment 3 for the QPMwP course. The assignment focused on implementing turnover calculation, transaction cost simulation, and performance statistics for portfolio backtesting.

## 1. Turnover Function Solution

```python
def turnover(self, return_series: pd.DataFrame, rescale: bool=True):
    """
    Calculate the turnover between consecutive portfolios.
    
    Args:
        return_series: DataFrame with returns of all assets
        rescale: Boolean indicating whether to rescale the weights
        
    Returns:
        Series with turnover values for each rebalancing date
    """
    dates = self.get_rebalancing_dates()
    to = {}
    to[dates[0]] = float(1)
    for rebalancing_date in dates[1:]:

        previous_portfolio = self.get_previous_portfolio(rebalancing_date)
        current_portfolio = self.get_portfolio(rebalancing_date)
        
        if current_portfolio.rebalancing_date is None or previous_portfolio.rebalancing_date is None:
            raise ValueError('Portfolios must have a rebalancing date')

        if current_portfolio.rebalancing_date < previous_portfolio.rebalancing_date:
            raise ValueError('The previous portfolio must be older than the current portfolio')

        # Get the union of the ids of the weights in both portfolios (previous and current)
        all_ids = set(previous_portfolio.weights.index) | set(current_portfolio.weights.index)

        # Extend the weights of the previous portfolio to the union of ids in both portfolios by adding zeros
        prev_weights_extended = pd.Series(0, index=all_ids)
        prev_weights_extended.loc[previous_portfolio.weights.index] = previous_portfolio.weights

        # Float the weights of the previous portfolio according to the price drifts in the market 
        # until the current rebalancing date
        floated_weights = floating_weights(
            X=return_series,
            w=prev_weights_extended,
            start_date=previous_portfolio.rebalancing_date,
            end_date=current_portfolio.rebalancing_date,
            rescale=rescale
        ).iloc[-1]

        # Extract the weights of the current portfolio
        current_weights_extended = pd.Series(0, index=all_ids)
        current_weights_extended.loc[current_portfolio.weights.index] = current_portfolio.weights

        # Calculate the turnover as the sum of absolute differences between floated weights and current weights
        to[rebalancing_date] = np.sum(np.abs(floated_weights - current_weights_extended))

    return pd.Series(to)
```

### Explanation

This turnover function calculates the turnover between consecutive portfolios by following these steps:

1. Initialize a dictionary to store turnover values for each rebalancing date, with the first entry set to 1.0
2. For each subsequent rebalancing date:
   - Get the previous and current portfolios
   - Validate that both portfolios have rebalancing dates and that the current one is newer
   - Find the union of asset IDs from both portfolios to ensure all assets are considered
   - Create extended weight series for both portfolios, filling any missing assets with zeros
   - Float the previous portfolio weights to the current rebalancing date using market returns
   - Calculate turnover as the sum of absolute differences between floated weights and current weights
3. Return the turnover values as a pandas Series

The `floating_weights` function accounts for how the portfolio weights would have evolved naturally due to market movements between rebalancing dates.

## 2. Simulation Function Solution

```python
def simulate(self,
            return_series: pd.DataFrame,
            fc: float = 0,
            vc: float = 0,
            n_days_per_year: int = 252) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Simulate portfolio returns with transaction costs.
    
    Args:
        return_series: DataFrame with returns of all assets
        fc: Fixed cost as annual percentage
        vc: Variable cost as percentage of turnover
        n_days_per_year: Number of trading days per year
        
    Returns:
        Series with portfolio returns
    """
    rebdates = self.get_rebalancing_dates()
    ret_list = []
    for rebdate in rebdates:
        next_rebdate = (
            rebdates[rebdates.index(rebdate) + 1]
            if rebdate < rebdates[-1]
            else return_series.index[-1]
        )

        portfolio = self.get_portfolio(rebdate)
        w_float = portfolio.float_weights(
            return_series=return_series,
            end_date=next_rebdate,
            rescale=False # Notice that rescale is hardcoded to False.
        )
        level = w_float.sum(axis=1)
        ret_tmp = level.pct_change(1)
        ret_list.append(ret_tmp)

    portf_ret = pd.concat(ret_list).dropna()

    if vc != 0:
        # Calculate turnover
        to = self.turnover(return_series=return_series,
                           rescale=False)
        
        # Calculate variable cost (vc) as a fraction of turnover and
        # subtract the variable cost from the returns at each rebalancing date
        for rebdate in rebdates:
            if rebdate in to.index and rebdate in portf_ret.index:
                # Apply variable cost as percentage of turnover on rebalancing dates
                portf_ret.loc[rebdate] -= to[rebdate] * vc

    if fc != 0:
        # Calculate number of days between returns
        days_between = pd.Series(index=portf_ret.index)
        for i in range(len(days_between)-1):
            days_between.iloc[i+1] = (portf_ret.index[i+1] - portf_ret.index[i]).days
        days_between.iloc[0] = 1  # Assume 1 day for the first entry
        
        # Calculate daily fixed cost based on the annual fixed cost (fc),
        # the number of days between two rebalancings and the number of days per year
        daily_fc = fc / n_days_per_year
        
        # Subtract the daily fixed cost from the daily returns
        portf_ret = portf_ret - daily_fc

    return portf_ret
```

### Explanation

This simulation function calculates portfolio returns incorporating transaction costs:

1. For each rebalancing date, calculate the portfolio's returns until the next rebalancing date
   - Get the portfolio at the current rebalancing date
   - Float the weights over time without rescaling
   - Calculate daily returns from the portfolio level
   - Store these returns in a list
2. Concatenate all return periods into a single series
3. Apply variable costs (if specified)
   - Calculate turnover between rebalancing periods
   - Subtract the variable cost (as a percentage of turnover) from returns on rebalancing dates
4. Apply fixed costs (if specified)
   - Calculate daily fixed cost by dividing annual fixed cost by trading days per year
   - Subtract this fixed cost from all daily returns
5. Return the adjusted return series

The function handles both variable costs proportional to turnover (applied only on rebalancing dates) and fixed costs (applied daily).

## 3. Performance Metrics Function Solution

```python
def calculate_performance_metrics(returns, n_days_per_year=252):
    """
    Calculate various performance metrics for a return series.
    
    Args:
        returns: Series of returns
        n_days_per_year: Number of trading days per year
    
    Returns:
        Series with performance metrics
    """
    # Ensure we have a clean Series
    returns = returns.dropna()
    
    # Calculate cumulative return
    cum_return = (1 + returns).prod() - 1
    
    # Calculate annualized return
    n_days = len(returns)
    ann_return = (1 + cum_return) ** (n_days_per_year / n_days) - 1
    
    # Calculate annualized volatility
    ann_vol = returns.std() * np.sqrt(n_days_per_year)
    
    # Calculate Sharpe ratio (assuming risk-free rate = 0)
    sharpe = ann_return / ann_vol if ann_vol != 0 else 0
    
    # Calculate maximum drawdown
    cum_returns = (1 + returns).cumprod()
    running_max = cum_returns.cummax()
    drawdown = (cum_returns / running_max - 1)
    max_drawdown = drawdown.min()
    
    return pd.Series({
        'Cumulative Return': f"{cum_return:.4f}",
        'Annualized Return': f"{ann_return:.4f}",
        'Annualized Volatility': f"{ann_vol:.4f}",
        'Sharpe Ratio': f"{sharpe:.4f}",
        'Maximum Drawdown': f"{max_drawdown:.4f}"
    })
```

### Explanation

This function calculates key performance metrics for a return series:

1. **Cumulative Return**: The total compounded return over the entire period
   - Calculated as the product of (1 + return) for all periods, minus 1
   
2. **Annualized Return**: The return normalized to an annual basis
   - Calculated using the formula: (1 + cumulative_return)^(252/n_days) - 1, where 252 is the assumed number of trading days per year
   
3. **Annualized Volatility**: The standard deviation of returns scaled to an annual basis
   - Calculated as the standard deviation of returns multiplied by the square root of 252
   
4. **Sharpe Ratio**: The excess return per unit of risk
   - Calculated as annualized return divided by annualized volatility (assuming a zero risk-free rate)
   
5. **Maximum Drawdown**: The largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value
   - Calculated by tracking the cumulative returns and their running maximum, then finding the largest percentage decline from a peak

The function returns all metrics formatted as a pandas Series with values rounded to 4 decimal places.

## Usage Example

To use these functions in the assignment notebook:

```python
# Overwrite the turnover method of the strategy object
bt_mv.strategy.turnover = types.MethodType(turnover, bt_mv.strategy)

# Overwrite the simulate method of the strategy object
bt_mv.strategy.simulate = types.MethodType(simulate, bt_mv.strategy)

# Calculate turnover
to = bt_mv.strategy.turnover(
    return_series=data['return_series'],
    rescale=True
)

# Simulate with different cost assumptions
sim_mv_gross = bt_mv.strategy.simulate(return_series=return_series, fc=0, vc=0)
sim_mv_net_of_fc = bt_mv.strategy.simulate(return_series=return_series, fc=0.01, vc=0)
sim_mv_net_of_vc = bt_mv.strategy.simulate(return_series=return_series, fc=0, vc=0.002)
sim_mv_net = bt_mv.strategy.simulate(return_series=return_series, fc=0.01, vc=0.002)

# Calculate performance metrics
performance = {}
performance['Mean-Variance (Gross)'] = calculate_performance_metrics(sim_mv_gross)
performance['Mean-Variance (Net of FC)'] = calculate_performance_metrics(sim_mv_net_of_fc)
performance['Mean-Variance (Net of VC)'] = calculate_performance_metrics(sim_mv_net_of_vc)
performance['Mean-Variance (Net)'] = calculate_performance_metrics(sim_mv_net)

# Display as DataFrame
performance_df = pd.DataFrame(performance).T
```

## Key Insights

When implementing and analyzing these functions, several key insights emerge:

1. **Turnover Calculation**: Proper turnover calculation must account for both asset additions/removals and the natural drift of portfolio weights due to market movements.

2. **Transaction Costs Impact**: The simulation shows how both fixed and variable costs can significantly impact long-term performance:
   - Fixed costs create a constant drag on returns
   - Variable costs based on turnover primarily affect returns around rebalancing dates
   - Combined costs can substantially reduce cumulative returns over time

3. **Performance Metrics**: The comprehensive metrics provide a clear picture of risk-adjusted performance:
   - Gross returns appear most favorable but are unrealistic
   - Net returns (after all costs) provide the most accurate picture of achievable performance
   - Metrics like Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown help assess the risk-adjusted efficiency of the strategy

These implementations allow for sophisticated analysis of portfolio strategies with realistic transaction cost assumptions.
